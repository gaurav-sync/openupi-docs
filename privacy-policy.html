    <h1>Privacy Policy for OpenUPI</h1>
    <p class="lead">Effective Date: <strong>[Insert Date]</strong></p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>OpenUPI ("we", "our", or "the App") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how OpenUPI handles information when you use the OpenUPI mobile application.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Information Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal or financial information. The app only uses your device's camera or images you explicitly select from your gallery to scan QR codes. All scanning and processing of QR code content occurs locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera</strong>: Required to scan QR/UPI codes with your device camera.</li>
    <li><strong>Gallery / Images</strong>: Required only if you choose to scan a QR code image from your device storage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No other permissions are requested by OpenUPI.</p>

  <h2>How the App Works</h2>
  <p>When a QR code is scanned, OpenUPI checks whether the scanned string is a UPI payment link (for example, starts with <code>upi://pay</code>). If it is a UPI link, the app opens the link using the Android system chooser so you can select one of the UPI/payment apps already installed on your device (for example, Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM). OpenUPI itself does not process, initiate, or complete any payment transactions — all payment flows occur inside the chosen third-party payment app.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share any user data with third parties because we do not collect or store any data. Any QR link data is processed locally and is not uploaded to servers.</p>

  <h2>Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>OpenUPI does not include analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies. There is no behavioral profiling or targeted advertising.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Because OpenUPI processes QR codes locally and does not transmit or store data, there is no server-side storage to secure. Please keep your device secure and use trusted payment apps to perform transactions.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Links & Apps</h2>
  <p>OpenUPI may redirect you to third-party UPI/payment apps to complete transactions. Those apps are governed by their own privacy policies and terms of service. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or security of third-party apps.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If material changes are made, we will update the "Effective Date" above. Continued use of the app after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> OpenUPI is a utility app that only scans QR codes and opens them in installed UPI/payment apps. It is not a payment processor, bank, or financial service provider.
